I'm doing this to make it useful for people, and the thing that has me going is to get your feedback on thoughts on how this is helpful and how I can improve it.

Furthermore, I would love to get any help possible, whether you can contribute with testing out the data, coming up with new ideas, writing code or developing models.

If you want to get in contact, please send an email to: b3@leetgroup.net
