Hi,

I'm a math enthusiast and self-taught programmer with a passion for finance. After seeing big swings in share prices around quarterly reporting based on "surprises" that I felt shouldn't have been surprises I started this project where I'm attempting to map out the full "digital footprint" of companies. From this footprint I then use mathematical models to derive the regularly reported company financials in real-time.

I have identified ~40 large companies that have significant "digital footprint", and I have started working on [Facebook/META]() which poked my interest as they had [very big swings]() in share price following their 2022Q1 and 2022Q2 earnings. These swings were almost solely based on surprises in user engagement, but at the same time Facebook has an enormous digital footprint strongly indicative of the underlying user engagement.

To my surprise, it seems that a project like this has not yet been undertaken. Most alternative data providers use broadly applied techniques and do not go deep into company specific data gathering, and even the more specialized alternative data providers are not covering Facebook (e.g. [Yipit](https://www.yipitdata.com/coverage), [MScience](https://mscience.com/files/coveragelist.pdf), [ThinkNum](https://www.thinknum.com/datasets/all)). The recent [Supreme court decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn) allows for even deeper crawling of data, further enabling the approach taken in this project.

I have data gathering for [Facebook/META]() running on a daily basis since early July 2022 ([download raw data]()), and I have models that currently generate the [user engagement portion of the reported metrics]() (which is what drew the [2022Q1 and 2022Q2]() swings in Facebook/META share price). The [methodology]() is pretty robust though there is bias mainly due to higher resolution on the digital footprint from the monetizeable part of Facebook/META.

This is a passion project of mine, and I would love to get in [contact]() with anyone finding this interesting. I'm very eager to get feedback, or maybe even help from anyone that would like to [contribute](). I need to add in a view on monetization for Facebook/META, but after that I think [next up]() will be Google/SNAP/Pinterest, maybe some of the airlines (DAL, LUV, UAL) or something specialized around Coinbase, Shopify or Airbnb.

Thanks, and I hope you find this useful!
