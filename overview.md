Hi,

I'm a math enthusiast and self-taught programmer who has a passion for finance. After seeing big swings in share prices around quarterly reporting based on "surprises" that I felt shouldn't have been surprises I started this project where I'm attempting to map out the full "digital footprint" of companies. From this footprint I then use mathematical models to derive predictive views of what this means for the regularly reported company financials.

I have identified [~40 companies]() that have significant "digital footprint", and I have started working on [Facebook](). Facebook had [big swings]() in share price for their 2022Q1 and 2022Q2 earnings based on surprises in user engagement. At the same time, Facebook has an enormous digital footprint that can be used to well predict the user engagement, and it seems that none of the alternative data providers have done this ([Yipit](https://www.yipitdata.com/coverage), [MScience](https://mscience.com/files/coveragelist.pdf), [ThinkNum](https://www.thinknum.com/datasets/all)). I'm currently able of [predicting user engagement]() on a weekly basis, with the underlying raw data ([download]()) refreshing on a daily basis.

This is a passion project of mine, and I would love you all to [contribute]() and get in [contact]() with feedback.

I hope you find this helpful!
