Hi,

I'm a math enthusiast and self-taught programmer with a passion for finance. Over the years I have observed the market be "surprised" by quarterly earnings reports resulting in big share price swings. Some of these "surprises" were in my mind unnecessary, in particular for companies with large "online footprints". Hence, I started [this project]() where I map out the full "online footprint" of select listed companies. Using this data I build mathematical models to derive the quarterly reported key metrics. I publish these metrics in real time on this project website, in hope of it creating a more efficient market.

To get started, [Facebook/META]() poked my interest as they had [very big swings]() in share price following their 2022Q1 and 2022Q2 earnings, almost solely driven by surprises in reported user metrics. So far, I have automatic raw data gathering running on a daily basis ([download raw data]()), and I have some basic models that currently generate [weekly views on company reported user metrics](). The [methodology]() is pretty robust though there are some blind spots (Whatsapp) and risk for bias (non-monetizeable users).

This is a passion project of mine, and I would love to get in [contact]() with anyone finding this interesting. I'm very eager to get feedback, or maybe even help from anyone that would like to [contribute](). After completing Facebook/META, I'm hoping to move on to Google/SNAP/Pinterest, maybe some of the airlines (DAL, LUV, UAL), and possibly something specialized around Coinbase, Shopify or Airbnb.

Thanks, and I hope you find this useful!

PS. It's worth noting that most alternative data providers only use broadly applied techniques and do not go deep into company specific data gathering, and therefore are not able of making assertions avoiding the above-mentioned surprises for Facebook/META in 20222Q1 and 2022Q2. There are more specialized alternative data providers (e.g. [Yipit](https://www.yipitdata.com/coverage), [MScience](https://mscience.com/files/coveragelist.pdf), [ThinkNum](https://www.thinknum.com/datasets/all)), but they mainly aggregate data sources to create company specific analysis rather than themselves doing primary company specific deeper data gathering.

PS2. Also worth noting is that the recent [Supreme court decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn) enables more freely and deeper data gathering, which arguably previously was not pursuable.
