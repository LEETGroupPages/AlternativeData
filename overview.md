Hi,

I'm a math enthusiast and self-taught programmer who has a passion for finance. After seeing big swings in share prices around quarterly reporting based on "surprises" that I felt shouldn't have been surprises I started this project where I'm attempting to map out the full "digital footprint" of companies. From this footprint I then use mathematical models to derive predictive views of what this means for the regularly reported company financials.

I have identified ~40 companies that have significant "digital footprint", and I have started working on [Facebook]() which had had [very big swings]() in share price following their 2022Q1 and 2022Q2 earnings. These swings were almost solely based on surprises in user engagement, but at the same time Facebook has an enormous digital footprint that can be used to well predict the user engagement. Most alternative data providers use broadly applied techniques and do not go deep into company specific data gathering, and even the more specialized alternative data providers are not covering Facebook (e.g. [Yipit](https://www.yipitdata.com/coverage), [MScience](https://mscience.com/files/coveragelist.pdf), [ThinkNum](https://www.thinknum.com/datasets/all)).

I have data gathering running since early July 2022 on a daily basis ([download raw data]()), and I have some models I'm currently able of [predicting user engagement]() on a weekly basis. The [methodology]() is pretty robust, and while limited backtesting is possible it should be predictive.

This is a passion project of mine, and I would love to get in [contact]() with anyone finding this interesting. I'm very eager to get feedback, or even help from anyone that would like to contribute.

Thanks, and I hope you find this helpful!
