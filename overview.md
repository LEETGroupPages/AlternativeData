Hi,

I'm a math enthusiast and self-taught programmer with a passion for finance. Over the last years I have on a continuous basis seen the market be "surprised" by quarterly earnings reports, leading to big swings in company share price. Some of these "surprises" should in my mind not have been surprises, in particular for companies that have large "online footprints". Hence, I started this project where I map out the full "online footprint" of a select set of companies. From this footprint I then use mathematical models to derive the quarterly reported key metrics. I do this in real-time and report it here on this project website in an attempt to help avoid the market being "surprised".

I have identified ~40 large companies that have significant "digital footprint", and I have started working on [Facebook/META]() which poked my interest as they had [very big swings]() in share price following their 2022Q1 and 2022Q2 earnings. These swings were almost solely based on surprises in user engagement. Facebook has a tremendously large "online footprint" which is stronly indicative of the underlying user engagement, which makes this a good first test-company.

I have data gathering for [Facebook/META]() running on a daily basis since early July 2022 ([download raw data]()), and I have models that currently generate the [user engagement portion of the reported metrics]() (which is what drew the [2022Q1 and 2022Q2]() swings in Facebook/META share price). The [methodology]() is pretty robust though there is bias mainly due to higher resolution on the digital footprint from the monetizeable part of Facebook/META.

This is a passion project of mine, and I would love to get in [contact]() with anyone finding this interesting. I'm very eager to get feedback, or maybe even help from anyone that would like to [contribute](). I need to add in a view on monetization for Facebook/META, but after that I think [next up]() will be Google/SNAP/Pinterest, maybe some of the airlines (DAL, LUV, UAL) or something specialized around Coinbase, Shopify or Airbnb.

Thanks, and I hope you find this useful!

PS.

It's worth noting that most alternative data providers use broadly applied techniques and do not go deep into company specific data gathering and therefore do not relieve company specific surprises like the above mentioned Facebook/META 20222Q1 and 2022Q2 surprises. There are more specialized alternative data providers (e.g. [Yipit](https://www.yipitdata.com/coverage), [MScience](https://mscience.com/files/coveragelist.pdf), [ThinkNum](https://www.thinknum.com/datasets/all)), but they mainly aggregate data sources to create company specific analysis rather than focusing on company specific deep data gathering. Also worth noting is that the recent [Supreme court decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn) now enables this deeper data gathering that arguably previously could not be pursued.
