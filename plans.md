### Facebook/META

Top priority right now is to expand the Facebook/META data from the current coverage of user data to also cover monetization, and as such enable daily reporting on Revenue.

### Companies to cover next

Following the methodology of Facebook/META, it would be fairly easy to also extend to the following companies:
* Pinterest: Clean data, only advertising revenue, 1-8% swings around earnings, user numbers very important as platform is in decline
* SNAP: Enormous swings around earnings (-22% in 2021Q3 and +46% in 2021Q4), mainly advertising revenue, revenue and users key driver but also profitability
* Twitter: Problematic with current Elon Musk takeover situation
* Google/Alphabet: Advertising largest portion of revenue but also many other business units, will require separate coverage of Youtube, Cloud, Display, Search, and some other properties

Another area that has caught my curiosity are the airlines. It seems that bookings and price are the key driver which should be possible to derive online. Profitability is also important which is driven by fuel prices and salaries which both should be possible to model. Target companies would include:
* Delta Airlines
* Southwest Airlines
* Ryanair
* United Airlines
There are some other bookings-driven companies that could be of interest like Booking Holdings, Expedia, Airbnb, Live Nation, Carnival and Royal Caribbean Cruises.

Gaming companies could also be of interest if going into the different platforms to derive usage numbers. For example the following targets could work:
* Activision Blizzard
* Electronic Arts
* TakeTwo Interactive

Lastly, there is a set of unique companies with unique digital footprint that could create outsized opportunity:
* Shopify: Large online footprint, unique set of data, predictable subscription model
* Roblox: Unique platform, everything online
* DraftKings: Unique platform, also everything online
* Coinbase: All transactions visible, and transactions being main revenue driver

### Contribute
